            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Hi! I'm Ashe Gravenkemper, and I recently moved to Dallas to start my college journey. Alongside my studies, I work as a senior technician at a gaming company, where I apply my technical skills in the industry. I also completed the Harvard CS50 Web Design program, which strengthened my passion for web development. My goal is to become a web developer, creating engaging and user-friendly websites that blend creativity with functionality.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>One of my biggest passions is <em>playing the bass.</em> I love the deep, powerful sound and how it lays the foundation of a song. Whether I'm learning new riffs or just jamming, it's my favorite way to express myself—especially with punk music, which has had a huge influence on me.</p>
        
            <p>I also have a creative side when it comes to hair. <em>Dyeing, bleaching, and cutting hair</em> is something I genuinely enjoy. It's exciting to mix colors, experiment with different styles, and help people achieve a look that makes them feel more confident. It's like an art form, and I love seeing the transformations.</p>
        
            <p>In my free time, I like to unwind with <em>League of Legends.</em> Whether I'm playing competitively or just for fun, I enjoy the teamwork, strategy, and challenge the game offers. Gaming is also a great way to connect with friends and meet new people.</p>
        
            <p>Another big interest of mine is <em>urbex—urban exploration.</em> There's something fascinating about discovering abandoned places, seeing what's been left behind, and capturing the atmosphere through photography. Every location has a unique history, and I love the adventure of exploring hidden or forgotten spaces.</p>
        
            <p>At the heart of all my hobbies is my love for<em> meeting new people.</em> Whether it's through music, gaming, or shared experiences, I enjoy making connections and learning from others. Life is about growth and discovery, and I'm always looking for new ways to explore the world around me.</p>
